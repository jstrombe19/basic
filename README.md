# basic

This is a simple application exploring the conversion of values between different bases. The initial implementation is that of a mono-directional conversion from base-10 integer values to a base-64 string.

The current implementation is now bi-directional between base-10 and base-64. 

Further development will accommodate bi-directional conversion using any number of bases for both the initial and converted values.

The goal for this app was to explore the conversion for later application in encoding algorithms with to achieve lossless data compression.
