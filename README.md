# basic

This is a simple application exploring the conversion of values between different bases. The initial implementation is that of a mono-directional conversion from base-10 integer values to a base-64 string.

Further development will accommodate bi-directional conversion using the base-10 and base-64 baseline, then expand into including any number of bases for both the initial and converted values.

The goal for this app was to explore the conversion for later application in encoding algorithms with the goal of lossless data compression.
